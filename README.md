## About the project
Our solution collects data :chart_with_upwards_trend: from the users which is sent to our data-base :file_folder: and a report :envelope: of this will be send to the local municipal department. This will help in prioritization of garbage collection to the bins :postbox: already filled.
In this way we will be able to save time :watch: and fuel :fuelpump:, thus improving the efficiency :truck: in the waste management.
